# Cauvet

An mostly amber-yellow colorscheme for Vim.

Chauvet is named after the cave which holds the worlds oldest known paintings,
which France made a 62.5 million dollar "simulacrum" of.

  Looking at Mustang today and variants, found Vitamins by same author.
  Looked like a nice orange/brown colorscheme, except in my terminal.
  So made my own first VIM colorscheme, tested in Xterm and gnome terminal.
